## Architecture Highlights

### Clean Code Principles

âœ… **Single Responsibility**: Each component does one thing well
âœ… **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Reused all existing components
âœ… **Separation of Concerns**: Data fetching, UI, and business logic separated
âœ… **Modularity**: Small, focused, reusable components
âœ… **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support

### Performance

- React Query for efficient data fetching
- Client-side caching
- Optimistic UI updates (via existing hooks)
- Minimal re-renders

---

## Code Statistics

### Lines of Code

- **New Code**: ~755 lines
- **Modified Code**: ~10 lines
- **Reused Code**: ~5,000+ lines

### Component Reuse Ratio

- **New Components**: 3
- **Reused Components**: 20+
- **Reuse Ratio**: 87%

## Testing Checklist

### âœ… Build Status
```bash
npm run build
âœ“ Compiled successfully
âœ“ No TypeScript errors
âœ“ Route generated: /curricula/[id]/builder
```

### Manual Testing (To Do)

**Navigation**:
- [ ] Click topics to expand
- [ ] Click nodes to expand
- [ ] Click activity to select
- [ ] Verify correct highlighting

**Form**:
- [ ] Edit instruction fields
- [ ] Change activity type
- [ ] Edit config fields
- [ ] Verify form updates

**Preview**:
- [ ] Type in fields â†’ preview updates
- [ ] Change activity type â†’ preview changes
- [ ] Test all 6 preview types

**Save**:
- [ ] Click save button
- [ ] Verify success toast
- [ ] Reload page â†’ changes persisted

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Phase 2: More Previews
- Add remaining 6 activity type previews
- Add basic interactivity (click to test)
- Add animations (balloon floating, etc.)

### Phase 3: Additional Features
- Previous/Next activity navigation buttons
- Duplicate activity button
- Quick search/filter activities
- Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+S to save)

### Phase 4: Advanced Tools
- Auto-save (every 3 seconds)
- Undo/redo functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Build Errors

If you encounter build errors:

```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next

# Reinstall dependencies
npm install

# Rebuild
npm run build
```

### TypeScript Errors

All types are properly defined. If you see errors:
- Check imports match exactly
- Ensure all dependencies are installed
- Restart TypeScript server (VS Code: Cmd+Shift+P â†’ "Restart TS Server")

### Runtime Errors

Check browser console for:
- Authentication issues (need to be logged in)
- API errors (check network tab)
- React Query errors (check devtools)

- âœ… Errors caught before publishing (should increase)
- âœ… Curriculum creator satisfaction (survey)
- âœ… Activities created per week (should increase)
